/// Gauntlet Sanctuary \\\
==========================

why "sanctuary" ?
I didnt feel like calling it a "port"

warning:

- this code is barely even beta - with almost no serious playtest
- there _are_ unfound bugs
- it could FAIL completely or partially for any number of reasons
- I can only get it to run in chrome with command line tweaks !
- see note on "unpinned edge" maps
- the github repository at this time does NOT contain a playable release...

running:

unpack Gauntlet.sanctuary.zip
open Gauntlet.sanctuary folder
1. click on sanctuary.bat
----> you must have chrome.exe installed in "C:\Program Files\chrome-win\chrome.exe"
or
2. click on index.html to launch in your default browser
----> the chances of this working are sort of slim

- in chrome I have to further click on a "(i) file " icon before the address "file:///F:/gauntlet.sanctuary.pr1/gauntlet.sanctuary.pr1/index.html" to run the first time

playing:

- options are below main screen:
Difficulty:  3  ARROW keys to move, HOLD SPACE to fire, ENTER to use potion - start on:  Level 1   Tutorial: <x>

1 should be pretty easy
3 is gauged to be medium
6 is somewhat hard
9 and up will be bonkers

the dial goes up to 30 - you can edit in any number you want  (heh heh)
keys are not yet reasign-able
Level 8 is the last level past 7 played - these are the semi-random levels
tutorial items only run once with announcer dialog

notes:

the only real fix for problems right now is a reload - the current game is lost

oddball lockups are possible - hitting F12 brings up a debugger in most browsers
the debugger is not likely to be of any help to anyone but me
you could screenshot the debug screen if you'd like and put it on the chan6 discord #qode

"unpinned edge" maps
some gauntlet maps scrolled endlessly across
this engine does NOT handle those
I made a silent edge swap teleport for the player - monsters and shots do not teleport
its very easy to get stuck on an edge
there is a 100 health tick safety system that will get you off the map
I'm not sure how to retool this engine to operate like gauntlet yet


current status:

- plays exactly like gauntlet 1
- it uses the gauntlet 1 maze layout mapping
- a random profile is used to load each maze
- treasure rooms are upscaled a bit with a longer timer

enhancements:

- select level 1 - 8 to start		(level 8 is whatever level past 7 was last played)
- turn off tutorial text checkbox
- skill level - random loads will be boosted by skill level -- you have been WARNED


left on main dev path:

- lobbers need to shoot correctly
- thief spawn, chase, steal & retreat to next lvl	(rn he performs oddly)
- some gauntlet 2 elements

furture dev to consider:

- bot players in lieu of multiplayer
- actual single system multiplayer on top that
- online cli / srv multiplayer		-- please dont invest heavily in this - it may NOT happen, ever

- procedure generated mazes
- buy stuff guy with more boost items & potions
- higher monster levels and new monsters
- possible new gameplay 		- play as dungeon master loading levels to stop bot players in a defense style game		-- again do NOT get hopes up on this


soon we can get our old school 80s arcade
gauntlet fix with NEW adventures!
