port list:


adjust teleporters to small random chance select another nearby tele
maybe make list of teles sorted by dist

- wall replace routine for surround & shadows
>trap walls, walls to exits, moving wall, random walls, std shot walls -- shootable walls ?

treasure rooms > music, annc count
>limited power - finish
>tween level screen - finish messages
+ text messages appearing
+ find hidden potion note
>make monsters slow on shot poison a timed effect - can cross lvl boundary
>rest of tutorial popup text
>think about shrinking gen / move dist ot true g1 levels?  (this will freeze monsters / gens while in viewport now)
-shootable "standard" wall - gives goody or baddy > need list of items
-moving "pattern" wall
-moving "ranodmly" wall
-- trap walls done
-invisible "become temp visible" walls -- likely a code deal with some overlay mask
announcer
rest of sound effects (thoughts to enhanced sound effects)
lobber shots & ai
thief op & ai
monster /gen health & kill -- vs. player shot power levels
player shot speed and power potions

save system via cooky

finish g1 map population
unpinned corners / edges
level wrap across left / right

g1 audio elements swap in	-> ref genesis sound test for note s
g1 gfx tiles
- spirtes		-- decide how much of this we want / can use
- walls & floors

WIP: arcade sound & gfx
tutorial messaging system


full walk dist (31 tiles)
warrior:	5.4 sec
wiz:			5.3 sec
valk:			4.5 sec
elf:				3.9 sec

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
(nominal fixes)

can you fight ghosts ?!

some issue shooting level 1 & 2 gens - see research level

diagonal shot fail between walls w/diagonal gap		< sort of works...spacing is just a bit off >
exits way too touch sensitive for exit maze levels
monsters seem "too" smart for g1
 
wiz fires pretty fast prior to extra shot speed (more than one shot on screen)
- demon shots need checked as well

do demons fire too fast?

> add a random start if map lacks one -- not g1 element, but to stop exception fault

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
(perhaps persistent issues)

movement is quirky compared to original
- not as precise, hard to hit an exact shot line - real joystick might fix this
- possibly check for a controller sensitivity option

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
elements I did not see:

special potions
temp invisible
shootable walls - the "dirt" kind
timed treasure rooms
thief & treasure bag from shooting thief
level wrap to opposite side

limited maps - many arcade maps are left out (though its likely the creator wanted original maps)

other elements to check:

corner unpin above level 100
levels flip / mirror above 100 -- code is done, needs logic control
shots stun & hurt other player levels
cant take keys / bombs after inv. full - cant walk through them either

door stall is 15 secs - difficult is 0 easiest

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

GII elements:

locked treasures
poison food / potion that slows monsters
moving exits
moving walls (regular phase, not random)
invisible walls (need a 50% vis on touch or shot option cooling to invisible after 4 mins) -- code to handle these as gII is done
super sorceror
mugger - thief that steals food
dragon
temp potions - repulse, invuln, super shot, reflective, teleport
stun tiles
force fields
moveable (pushable) walls
shootable "regular" walls that give goody
"flicker" random walls
"special" treasure room
monsters move different, or faster
x--- acid blob (if used, it needs a weakness, like 2x potion fire destroys, or super / reflect shot destroys)
x--- "IT" - not sure want this

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
expansion:

training level with all aspects of game
> training "skill" level - no bonus mult, no HS, exits to itself, hints allowed

poss xp system for enhance stuff (sep from buy stuff guy)

difficulty system >> cheat (no HS, no bonus x), trainer, easy, normal, { }, hard, nightmare
\options on tutorial system, announcer
genesis gIV - quest, ? battle, record
+music from this is good too

4th level+ monters & generators
- ghosts will get to shoot
- grunts will throw clubs infreq
- demons will have "fire"

more powerful enemies may drop items - food, treasure, weapons, etc


randomly leave out wall -> exit if more than {X} wall segs
yellow teleports that can select further away
blue or purple teleports that are unit linked - not to nearest visible
pushable or shootable walls to temp block a teleport
respawning generators (none respawn > level 4)
enhance invisible wall code so - shots, potions, or some limited item makes walls slightly visible

new maps, perhaps with a maphack type system using the "image" set ops
"bonkers" level - see 207 img from bkg set - (in this case, do a "close to player" exit incase level is not playable)
lvl 1-7 as gauntlet (or alternates)
level 8-69 from gauntlet set
\option to randomize these maps -^
unpin, mirror & flip 70 - 99
100+ add in new maps, enhancements
- slow down treasure rooms occur freq, but every 4th have a chance for a "super" treasure room
- super treasure room idea - potion bomb "key" blocks & perm potion "key" blocks

monsters could act even weirder - like a bunch just run off until they "see" a player later
- some might be "bonkers", attacking other monsters, taking & holding keys or treasures
- "patrol" monsters that walk a beat until they "see" a player
basilisk

buy stuff guy, with new stuffs, keys, food, potions. temps

difficulty title ideas

walk in the park
monsters with no claws
dungeon
nightmare
walking on spikes
running in flaming oil
valley of the shadow of death


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
code fails
* leaving out player start...fails - with a black screen
, (comma) left out of var list or anywhere else it expects one
-- strangely ; is not much of an issue in similar places
if (cell.ptr.door) - when .ptr is undefined


issues when going multiplayer:

cli / srv model for over net play
- cli will just be render engine, have to report all controls back

troomtime counted in autohurt

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
done:

x-- wiz potion fire does not kill gens
	- killing gens is now distance (radius) derived - even warrior does some damage close up

x-- title screen scroll
-- can this be a .gif anim ?
x-- intro screen sequence
-- rotate thru image set
-- with demo play (ogg vid)
	> excepting posting saved scores
	> and monster level > 3 boost stats display -- if we want to give those

x-- levels loop with random select

x-- doors auto open on stall timer
x-- walls -> exits on stall timer long
x-- cant shoot over exits !
	(could also shoot over keys)

x-- level 1 & 2 gens & monsters set in level
x-- monster / generator levels ? - by score and monster health I am not sure this is implemented the same as gauntlet arcade
	- done visually, health & kill must be tested vs. player shots

x-- multi point death potion kill = 1000, 2000,1000, 4000, 2000, 6000, 2000, 8000

x-- score multiplier - _______- since multi-player isnt finished I'll gather this was left unfinished as well
	- a single player "times out" multiplier is done
	- multiplayer followup will expand that code

x-- floors are (mostly) g1 accurate
	- walls are an approximation based on gJ designed walls

x-- teleporters
	- the g1 fade controlling which nearest telep is not implemented

x-- traps making walls vanish - up to 16 diff trap / wall linked elements as of now

x-- shootable food / potions

x-- doors now open nominally as g1, counterclockwise and display as g1 doors
	- there may still be corner piece flaws

x-- powers - score display
-->powers - ops finish
>> still need tweaked to g1 stats - at least armor and magic are not even boosts for all player classes
x-- gens offscreen are active, as are monsters (test original to see if monsters can move off screen)
x-- tween level screen (and poss. future options)

x-- fix aminimated grunt club for lvl 1,2
X-- flash player for invisible

x-- shootable "dirt" walls - "some walls may be destroyed" first time shot
	- use shoot food entry - revise health, 3 shots 
	- make no touch
	- special overlay gfx on this

x-- shootable "dirt" walls

x-- treasure room, timer, score, fail, msgs

expanded done:

x-- score mult applies to potion death pts, but perhaps 50% of mult
-- added more fake items - shotable and permanent
