mod list:

(nominal fixes)

wiz fires pretty fast prior to extra shot speed (more than one shot on screen)
wiz potion fire does not kill gens

gens offscreen are active, as are monsters (test original to see if monsters can move off screen)

\\\
do demons fire too fast?

(perhaps persistent issues)

movement is quirky compared to original
- not as precise, hard to hit an exact shot line - real joystick might fix this
- possibly try a controller sensitivity option

elements I did not see:

multi point death potion kill = 1000, 2000,1000, 4000, 2000, 6000, 2000, 8000
score multiplier - since multi-player isnt finished I'll gather this was left unfinished as well
monster / generator levels ? - by score and monster health I am not sure this is implemented the same as gauntlet arcade
lobbers missing
thief & treasure bag from shooting thief
timed treasure rooms
teleporters

door opening needs checked to see if the "corner rule" is obeyed - code looks like the entire door just opens

limited maps - many arcade maps are left out (though its likely the creator wanted original maps)

other elements to check:

corner unpin above level 100
levels flip / mirror above 100
levels loop with random select
shootable food / potions
shots stun & hurt other player levels
temp invisible
traps
shootable walls - the "dirt" kind
cant take keys / bombs after inv. full - cant walk through them either
doors auto open on stall timer
walls -> exits on stall timer long

arcade sound & gfx


GII elements:

locked treasures
poison food / potion that slows monsters
moving exits
moving walls (regular phase, not random)
invisible walls (need a 50% vis on touch or shot option cooling to invisible after 4 mins)
super sorceror
mugger - thief that steals food
dragon
temp potions - repulse, invuln, super shot, reflective, teleport
stun tiles
force fields
moveable (pushable) walls
shootable "regular" walls that give goody
"flicker" random walls
"special" treasure room
monsters move different, or faster
x--- acid blob (if used, it needs a weakness, like 2x potion fire destroys, or super / reflect shot destroys)
x--- "IT" - not sure want this


expansion:

4th - 6th level monters & generators
score mult applies to potion death pts, but perhaps 50% of mult
yellow teleports that can select further away
blue or purple teleports that are unit linked - not to nearest visible
pushable or shootable walls to temp block a teleport
respawning generators (none respawn > level 4)

new maps, perhaps with a maphack type system using the "image" set ops
"bonkers" level - see 207 img from bkg set - (in this case, do a "close to player" exit incase level is not playable)
lvl 1-7 as gauntlet
level 8-69 from gauntlet set
unpin, mirror & flip 70 - 99
100+ add in new maps, enhancements
- slow down treasure rooms occur freq, but every 4th have a chance for a "super" treasure room
- super treasure room idea - potion bomb "key" blocks & perm potion "key" blocks

monsters could act even weirder - like a bunch just run off until they "see" a player later
- some might be "bonkers", attacking other monsters, taking & holding keys or treasures
- "patrol" monsters that walk a beat until they "see" a player
basilisk

buy stuff guy, with new stuffs, keys, food, potions. temps
