gJ - gauntlet javascript		(gJ.0 - original)
================================================================================================================================================


-- upload notes on days ending in 9


dev:

push wall collision
 \ x-- elevate them above other treasure tiles


limited teleport does not: telefrag (it uses fight to kill monsters), blot out walls
-- reasonably sure in g2, _everything_ not on an edge wall was bounced over (food, treasure, doors, keys, pot, etc)


note: the lobber shot ext in entities.png

complete gwal shotwalls (refers to crafted shotwals in some gwals)
ent level walls do not yet blend

add provision for using orig sound fx on jsgv levels, if installed
(this is trickier than it sounds, since sounds are all cfg { } preload)

"all walls are invisible" lvl load msg & condition test

option to have monsters: take tile dmg, slow in glue, etc

could limit "slide" of monsters in strict g1/g2 mode

replace/remove cfg - chk box & text value, if value is empty, remove

heu override code to place 2 digit item under: trap wall, shot wall, gudy wall, cycle wall
- this could also be done with SVRLOAD and some adapted code

adjust trap walls: remove trap now has to look for restore trap and v-v

perhaps a music play queue for sequences of annouces that currently overlap ?
- mostly when a treasure room has a potion, or ssop/shop and something else play at lvl start

save highscore table, cookys, & storage for reload

unsave change flag to check on ed level reload
select level to edit
set lvnum, name, url, (maybe wall, floor), gwal, gflr, unpins, nornd, rtime, help, inv, ovrload
OVRLOAD - load instead of mapdata from url
SVRLOAD - load on top of mapdata from url

imm issues:

may want to up max skill that stores highscores
(this is janky tho and needs tested as higher skills add a lot of helper items)

original jsgv levels test had some x wrap issue when > 31 units
- this may have been after a treasure level that snuck in
- retest did not confirm t-level caused this

cycle walls display wrong off state ?	(is this rotate issue? not seeing now)

score table doesnt always show after a quit (may not be issue after splash cyc restore)
started one time from score talbe and scores did not go away


check sound for picking poison (is potion pick sound?, need g2 ref)


is it still too easy to hit exits (exit maze) & stun tiles ?
are the release walls traps to easy to see?


cycle walls have some tracking issues and blockage issues

armor doesnt match g1/g2 - should be one of the option items


need sounds:

(rest of them...)



port list:



theif / mugger should fight monsters in path - get blocked by object on start, pushwall across path
\_ this is, amazingly, way more difficult than expected to implement
 \_ even blocking the theif in path is most challenging

g1 gfx tiles
- spirtes		-- decide how much of this we want / can use
g1 has some sprites that seem to "oversize" the map cell - ref. box generators, foods, etc
(test with custom per-item scaling we added)

player dmg: melee
melee mis gens
monster dmg: melee - turn off autohurt to test
g1: lvl 1 grunt - 10 dmg / sec to warrior

is it possible to code adjust the "contained" corner	(re wall changes)
\_ this can be done if changed cells have a "dirty" flag and gfloor can be copied from sep canvas ctx

player shot speed (xshot speed is not tested, seems fast)

>a few announce & help msg left - ssop, etc.
>not all g1 audio fx in use
- thought to limit announce during treasure room count down


>make monsters slow on shot poison a timed effect - can cross lvl boundary
>think about shrinking gen / move dist ot true g1 levels?  (this will freeze monsters / gens while in viewport now)

save system via cooky - needs adjust to take less cooky space
> score tables
> input name, pick custom color (hue shift selector for this)
(way to look at all scores ?, clear below top 10 & clear all, send to server?)

finish g1 map population

g1 audio elements swap in	-> ref genesis sound test for note s

g2:

map editor o/p scanner
-push wall pushing collision
-cycle wall issues

acid puddle does nto move randomly yet

new-ish:

loadable wall seg, other modes (a la druid)
hue shift floors & loadable wall segment

:- possible multiple floor tile loader	(bigger tile area - victory road tex)
trainable map reader (load g2 maps from maze ed, speccy maps)
2nd player local

what would cookie overrides control ?
what overrides/ cheats should players have ?

companion potion: cat face on blue potion
- potion active, next creature you touch becomes follower companion
- will stay with you until you die, then they are released
-
- ghosts kill accd to level on touch - 1st level ghost kills 1 level of enemy
- grunts beat on enemies and loot treasure, transfer to you on touch
- demons shoot things and collect food
- sorcerors pick up potions and they can detonate as elf (good for war, val)
- lobbers shoot over walls
- death - does buku touch damage to all enemies except other death
- acid blob - does large damage as well and wobbles around
- super sorceror also have shot, wizard lvl potion skill, teleport behind walls to attack


limits on g1, g2, sanctuary (items, monsters, modes, extras ...)
\_selectable list of options for std elements, extras, overrides, etc

gauntness w & f + gauntlet like wall tiles

mappy idea: 5 items in troom, 2x 3x 4x 5x 6x multiplier for gather in seq


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
WIP: arcade sound & gfx


full walk dist (31 tiles)
warrior:	5.4 sec
wiz:			5.3 sec
valk:			4.5 sec
elf:				3.9 sec

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
(nominal fixes)


some issue shooting level 1 & 2 gens - see research level

diagonal shot fail between walls w/diagonal gap		< sort of works...spacing is just a bit off >
-- this comes from player cbox size not setting player in correct spot for shot

monsters seem "too" smart for g1 -- these are good for g2 "monsters may move differently"
 
wiz fires pretty fast prior to extra shot speed (more than one shot on screen)
- demon shots need checked as well

do demons fire too fast?


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
(perhaps persistent issues)

movement is quirky compared to original
- not as precise, hard to hit an exact shot line - real joystick might fix this
- possibly check for a controller sensitivity option

G IV elements:

coward (runs away) treasures
mimic (evil, attacks) treasures (enh: add locked chest)

tiles:
no fire

blow (wind)
damage (fire)

4 gateway stones
(also main dragon protector)

up & down stairs
buy stuff guy (thief sprite, so go figure)
central hub to earth, water, wind, fire towers & main castle

shootable walls are shaded reg. walls
(saw none that were gudy bady walls)

rings:
float over (wont hit tele, tiles, etc)
heal

upgrade abilities/ health w/exp system
(health has an upper limit)
weapon / item advancement system that enh. abilities
camping mode allows upgrades, select activatable item


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

sanctuary elements:

skill selection (arcade op chose)
select starting level 1-7 or last 8th played


generators for: death, acid puddle, theif, mugger, super sorceror
more elements added to shot gudwall
+500 pts for empty locked chest
add pts for other things not pointed (lvl exit, acid blob, IT (killable too), shot walls...)
limited life booster (amiga gfx set: ank)

lobber targeting may be different (& range)
poison (consumed) effect is different
multiple added fake items
moving exit randomness diff
phase walls not operate same (standing in wall appear spot)

random level contents profile (used for treasure room content too)
maze solver path system

multi color walls - include shotwalls, gud walls, pass & cycle walls
blur together diff wall colors
indiv cell invisible walls + invis shotwall (seperate from level wide invis walls)
\_ visible walls when level wide walls are invis
invis wall hint override

more floor tiles display (smol) besides main level tile
hue override ents, cell tile & content
cell tile all color provision
\_spec color under transparent tile
adds new floor tile gfx

liquid textures (slow & damage so far)

viewport size adjustable 10 - 40

monsters seem slightly smarter

shoot thru diagonal wall issue

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
expansion:

Gauntlet anti-hero -- play as DM, stock dungeons with elements to stop bot heros
-- cost system - if adding extra 5 3lvl ghost gen, have to put in 2 potions or 4 shot foods, etc
-- use rng load profiles basis

training level with all aspects of game
> training "skill" level - no bonus mult, no HS, exits to itself, hints allowed, random load items only

poss xp system for enhance stuff (sep from buy stuff guy)

difficulty system >> cheat (no HS, no bonus x), trainer, easy, normal, { }, hard, nightmare
\options on tutorial system, announcer
genesis gIV - quest, ? battle, record
+music from this is good too

higher difficulty may change:
- generator speed
- monster speed, health, item drops
- wallstall & doorstall 			(the ol' wait for walls->exits to skip hard levels)
- temporary item use time (longer or shorter)
- locked chest & shot wall items
- confusion item (sprite images are mixed up)

4th level+ monters & generators
- ghosts will get to shoot
- grunts will throw clubs infreq
- demons will have "fire"
- lobbers can throw temporary glue

mimics - look like treasure chest/ locked chest - attaks buku dmg, contains special artifact

more powerful enemies may drop items - food, treasure, weapons, etc

randomly leave out wall -> exit if more than {X} wall segs
yellow teleports that can (possibly player) select further away
blue or purple teleports that are unit linked - not to nearest visible
pushable or shootable walls to temp block a teleport
respawning generators (none respawn > level 4)
enhance invisible wall code so - shots, potions, or some limited item makes walls slightly visible

new maps, perhaps with a maphack type system using the "image" set ops
larger walls, 2nd level, lower levels (composit area and scale down, show past edges
stairs, elevators, special teleports
-- (one idea, a hue override or so that makes a 2nd floor not show, while stored, beyond the map border)
"bonkers" level - see 207 img from bkg set - (in this case, do a "close to player" exit incase level is not playable)
lvl 1-7 as gauntlet (or alternates)
level 8-69 from gauntlet set
\option to randomize these maps -^
unpin, mirror & flip 70 - 99
100+ add in new maps, enhancements - unless blocked
- slow down treasure rooms occur freq, but every 4th have a chance for a "super" treasure room
- super treasure room idea - potion bomb "key" blocks & perm potion "key" blocks
( or cfg page options on all this ... )

monsters could act even weirder - like a bunch just run off until they "see" a player later
- some might be "bonkers", attacking other monsters, taking & holding keys or treasures
- "patrol" monsters that walk a beat until they "see" a player
basilisk
shapeshifter - has base unit health, takes form & health of ent it touches, 
- lose 1 base unit of health when it reverts (as the form it took is killed)

buy stuff guy, with new stuffs, keys, food, potions. temps

new items:
ressurection potion / device
swords (a la saberhagens swords)
red keys for gold doors & gold treasure chest
blue keys for special treasure rooms (secret rooms)
black keys for the "pale gate"
some time of time travel potion or device (require a lot of smart data storage to track all changes)
"flash" speed device (select path, load potion to specials, hit go button
land of lost pylon or other seperate dim space rooms that open above maze while maze pauses (or not)
some type of flying ent, poss player controlled
pets / helpers (e.g. magic sword companions)

inventory system past keys, potions & specials
- base hold 6 items
- swap special potions, temporary items (freeze at count & store that)
- drop items on floor & not touch 5 secs or so
\_ also ability to toggle touch own dropped items
- potion or bag to expand inventory


difficulty title ideas

walk in the park
monsters with no claws
dungeon
nightmare
walking on spikes
running in flaming oil
valley of the shadow of death

char stats:
player stats:		(once we have name keeping)

- max time played, max time on level
\____ may add a further per adventure mode...
- foods eaten, health accum
- potions & items collected
- potions fired, keys used
- damage taken, tot autohurt
- each type of monster & gen destroyed
- total play stats per life & poss per map stats

crossovers interested in:

victory road
archon
time bandit

doom
quake
crossfire (sierra vision 1984)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
code fails
* leaving out player start...fails - with a black screen
, (comma) left out of var list or anywhere else it expects one
-- strangely ; is not much of an issue in similar places
if (cell.ptr.door) - when .ptr is undefined


issues when going multiplayer:

cli / srv model for over net play
- cli will just be render engine, have to report all controls back

troomtime counted in autohurt					(along with a bunch of other stuff now)
all the non player count down items should prob. be on setTimeout() or locked out timer

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

done:

x-- save rand load level for replay

------------------- 023.12.29

x-- shop, ssop, unpins, mirrors code not finished yet
   \- add: base% ea., max% all, %inc/%dec abv/blw mid skill, %inc per level
    \_ needs test out via multi level play

x-- solid walls, lattice (lvl 63) -- off by 1 pixel left, lattice L corner malformed

x-- gwal door replace over: gdor = 1 (repl) -1 (dont repl but add to gfi)
  - gfi adds 1 for gdor if present
  - gdor replace in sprite render (switch spriteset on flag for adddoor)
  - gitm - replace up to 10+ treasure img following doors: key, gold box, potion, food, poison, exit, +2 more

x-- add sfi/pfi layers to gwal, level.gfi is count of fakes (and active logic)
    - gshw * 2 (+ GWDEF cur. 2) is start # after walls / shootable walls, loaded from 0x8100, 0x812F
    - gdor: door layer, gitm: specific items (swap out or new) layer count of tiems

x-- ffield display is borken - field works, not visual
   \_ was this change:: this.frame = animate(frame, this.type.fpf, this.type.frames); to:: this.type.fpf, this.frames);

x-- ncfi / pfi / sfi in gwal by code cnt

x-- shot expire change - 10 tiles off screen expires player shot, monster shot expires instantly

x-- remove cooky store of score table
   \_ save top 4 each char in storage - keep scores in array, xfer top 4 of each over

x-- g2 set of exits (select 1 rest are fake) not implemented yet

x-- converting g2 walls / floors + g1 walls

x-- can no longer set still in damage liquid/tiles or active forcefield and NOT take damage

x-- trap walls not replacing all shadows, now (seems to work at this point)
   \_ nor do commit notes id the issue

------------------- 023.11.29

x-- loadable wall segments & cell.spriteset (ops complete, walls gfx will take some time)
   \_ gwal subset can have more than 1 wall/ destroywall, extra minitiles, its own shadow set (or no shadow at all)
    \_ possibly also add extra permanent and shootable fake items
     _ all controlled by a per-level set of vars with std items available above that #

x-- keypile pickup incorrect

x-- change fadeout on 1pl die - maybe allow re-entry if right away (6..no wait, 10 secs hang)
   \_ hold until die testing for a coindrop

x-- inv wall hint/cheet not on: gud, pass, phase, rnd walls

x-- rotate & liquid pool edges - only need one tag that auto selects from 4 possible with pooltype(tx, ty, map);
   \_ but keep 1st liquid only (no edges) for just that

x-- super sorc shots no longer damage player (it was all monster shots...)

x-- theif is also starting in treasure rooms (code logic is otherwise...)

x-- make it so difficulty cant be set back below 9 after racking a buku score on diff: 999 or so

x-- dying with keys (and potion) doesnt produce key/ potion pile
   \_ also produces a live gen when making lvl 3 bone pile

x-- look at treasure collect giving score mult logic (is as designated, based on difficulty)

x-- invisible "become temp visible" walls (when option & shot) -- likely a code deal with some overlay mask
    \_ perm hint walls, but always on (not intending to keep this)

x-- css to resize score table based on various viewport - 384 x 384 to 1050 x 1050
   \_ added title font size adjust

------------------- 023.11.19

x-- added a page bezel offscreen of game

x-- super sorc finish

x-- invisible sorcerors COULD be shot/ fought

x-- dead player is only lvl 1 bone pile

x-- shotwall colors not hue shifting
   \_check what shotwalls do when reg level walls are invis

x-- upgrade sprites to always use ent.sx / ent.sy instead of ent.type.sx (and maybe the rest as well)

x-- rotated maps with a single unpin edge end up scrolling wrong

x-- variable viewport so arcade mode can be accomodated

x-- stalling with keys takes 2 * stall for doors
    (also might be affected by skill -- not much accd to res.)
   \_ takes about 18 health (without keys) and 36 health (with keys) to stall the doors and about 325 health to stall the walls
    \_ walls about twice as long in Gauntlet 2 than in Gauntlet

x-- x0F0000 remove from TYPE mask & use for extra sets of gfx

x-- sprite oversize... generator oversize worked - this can be implemented, check g1 & g2

x-- lobber shots & move logig

x-- super shots possibly should destroy more than its coded to now (reg food, treasure, etc)
   \_done, but based on a vague memory - needs tested in g2

x-- annc for g2 limiteds

x-- some g2 sounds may need vol atten -- in progress
   \_overall might want to regig as many as poss. from a cleaner source
x-- g2 announcer does not match g1	(replaced from machine sample)

n-  note: movex must have movement active on load

x-- movex are solid on load until cycle

x-- too many shots with reflective shots

------------------- 023.11.09

--- > moving wall, random walls
   \_ shadows with these have excessive cost of re-write of map bkg every second

x-- reflective shots bouncy bounce

x-- mugger ops
x-- thief start snd, taunts
   \_( thief does not "travel" like a monster, he is moved along a path...no matter what )

x-- rand load is borken ! (user choice difficulty was set 0, code was gud)

x-- color match 40401F walls & loadable wall with them | _ section

x-- moving exits (they may be a bit more "random" than g2)

x-- g2 phase wall, rnd wall

x-- water, lava, toxic sludge, glue - need slow effect

x-- teleporters, shots cross the unpin line

x-- jsgv maze tiles are not proper update on floor obscuring-ent removal and some direct displays
	\_ floor ops may get a revision to settle tile differences of MEXLOW selected tiles1
	 | this update is partially complete, short of re-org on backgrounds.png

x-- move across unpin in 1/ 2 unit tunnel fails
   \_this fix is not the ideal, but it stumps along
   
x-- RND food - g2 ops (rn is rnd value 50 - 200 in 50pt increments)

x-- redone with '.muted' option on <video> and no extra files
x-- mute button & NOBKGMUSIC do not work with ogv that has audio (fix at cost of more large vid files)

xxx (maybe) try render to map.background for animated liquids / floor tiles
o-- this will not work on a frame by frame due to the time required to render the entire map bkg
   \_it might be possible to only write the liquid tiles in if they are in viewport, but that is not much diff from current ops

x-- locked treasure needs item load (rn just gives 500 pts treasure value, no displ)
  - also need debounce on appearing items - so we can also drop items in enhance inv. mode
   \_ these two are not the actual g2 RNG, which is not known, so just approximations

x-- also see if shootable tunnel cfgs walls around it, and reajust them after shot open
x-- prob need to extra re-wall code from traps & make generic for the several wall adjust items
   \_done but remaps entire map background - ok for traps, but needs tightened for rnd & shot walls

x-- g2 std wall shotable, item load initial

x-- g2 acid blob (rem. to add super sorc) dbl potion destruct

x-- monsters target across the unpin line

x-- draw pushwalls last,

x-- interior corners removed from big wall blocks, map creation coded cleaned up

x-- save death magic kill pts val

x-- poison dizzy effect, controls now have some wobble

x-- death point scores on potion splash
   \treasure points scores for 100, 500 pts

x-- wizard gets reg potion when he picks up xmagic (as per g1)

x-- shot a shotable fake item: help/ annc

x-- should locked chest display help/annc on touch w/o key? - yes, done

x-- g2 sound samples at low-med volume

x--figure out how to write a color to a 32x32 tile

		ctx.rect(32, 64, 32, 32);	// x,y,w,h
		ctx.fillStyle = "#FF00FF";	// color unit
		ctx.fill();

x-- find out if all drawImage() can bue hue shifted -- looks to be possible
	\ any write can be hue shifted with ctx.filter = "hue-rotate({N}deg)";

------------------- 023.10.29

x-- teleport on death needs to remove death (or any other teleported on monster)

x-- shorten ffield sound -- done to 4.5 secs, 1/2 sec fade, but needs further testing
	| now 3.5 secs, fade last 0.4 sec
    \ lower vol as well

x-- slowpoison sound on shot, extend 30 secs, attenuate slow fade, lower vol
	g2 -shooting poison should play the sound

x-- dev: freeze monster / sotp gen
x--      stop health -1 / sec
x-- dev / options sticky via cooky

x-- ffield, acid, it, wall move (all gII)

x-- forcefield ops cycles

x-- you CAN fight death!
    can you fight ghosts ?!
   \_ notfot var - if true you can not fight this ent

x-- acid blob entry is spawning ghosts

x-- exits way too touch sensitive for exit maze levels
   \ better but still touchy with xspeed & elf

x-- things that dont get shot: keys, stun, trap, forcefield tiles
   \ adding the fake items (not shootable) extra: key, exit

x-- purple walls 40400A have corner mismatches - see screen
   \ and a bunch more on L T and + sections

x-- wiz potion fire does not kill gens
	- killing gens is now distance (radius) derived - even warrior does some damage close up

x-- title screen scroll
-- can this be a .gif anim ?
x-- intro screen sequence
-- rotate thru image set
-- with demo play (ogg vid)
	> excepting posting saved scores
	> and monster level > 3 boost stats display -- if we want to give those

------------------- pre 023

x-- levels loop with random select

x-- doors auto open on stall timer
x-- walls -> exits on stall timer long
x-- cant shoot over exits !
	(could also shoot over keys)

x-- level 1 & 2 gens & monsters set in level
x-- monster / generator levels ? - by score and monster health I am not sure this is implemented the same as gauntlet arcade
	- done visually, health & kill must be tested vs. player shots

x-- multi point death potion kill = 1000, 2000,1000, 4000, 2000, 6000, 2000, 8000

x-- score multiplier - _______- since multi-player isnt finished I'll gather this was left unfinished as well
	- a single player "times out" multiplier is done
	- multiplayer followup will expand that code

x-- floors are (mostly) g1 accurate
	- walls are an approximation based on gJ designed walls

x-- teleporters
	- the g1 fade controlling which nearest telep is not implemented

x-- traps making walls vanish - up to 15 diff trap / wall linked elements as of now
    - traps have some issue where invalid cells are picked in mpixel while removing walls

x-- shootable food / potions

x-- doors now open nominally as g1, counterclockwise and display as g1 doors
	- there may still be corner piece flaws

x-- powers - score display
-->powers - ops finish
