fails
* leaving out player start...fails - with a black screen
, (comma) left out of var list
if (cell.ptr.door) - when .ptr is undefined


port list:

powers - score display
limited power - (poss. score display as well, why not)
announcer
rest of sound effects (thoughts to enhanced sound effects)
treasure rooms, music, countdown, scoring
tween level screen (and poss. future options)
lobber shots & ai
monster /gen health & kill -- vs. player shot power levels

save system via cooky


g1 audio elements swap in
g1 gfx tiles
- spirtes
- walls & floors
x- floors are (mostly) g1 accurate
 - walls are an approximation based on gJ designed walls


(nominal fixes)

some issue shooting level 1 & 2 gens - see research level

diagonal shot fail between walls w/diagonal gap		< sort of works...spacing is just a bit off >
exits way too touch sensitive for exit maze levels
monsters seem "too" smart for g1
 
wiz fires pretty fast prior to extra shot speed (more than one shot on screen)
- demon shots need checked as well

gens offscreen are active, as are monsters (test original to see if monsters can move off screen)

do demons fire too fast?

(perhaps persistent issues)

movement is quirky compared to original
- not as precise, hard to hit an exact shot line - real joystick might fix this
- possibly try a controller sensitivity option



elements I did not see:

special potions
thief & treasure bag from shooting thief
timed treasure rooms
shootable walls - the "dirt" kind
level wrap to opposite side
temp invisible
tutorial messaging system is differnt

door opening needs checked to see if the "corner rule" is obeyed - code looks like the entire door just opens

limited maps - many arcade maps are left out (though its likely the creator wanted original maps)

other elements to check:

corner unpin above level 100
levels flip / mirror above 100
shots stun & hurt other player levels
cant take keys / bombs after inv. full - cant walk through them either

WIP: arcade sound & gfx

full walk dist (31 tiles)
warrior:	5.4 sec
wiz:			5.3 sec
valk:			4.5 sec
elf:				3.9 sec


door stall is 15 secs - difficult is 0 easiest

GII elements:

locked treasures
poison food / potion that slows monsters
moving exits
moving walls (regular phase, not random)
invisible walls (need a 50% vis on touch or shot option cooling to invisible after 4 mins)
super sorceror
mugger - thief that steals food
dragon
temp potions - repulse, invuln, super shot, reflective, teleport
stun tiles
force fields
moveable (pushable) walls
shootable "regular" walls that give goody
"flicker" random walls
"special" treasure room
monsters move different, or faster
x--- acid blob (if used, it needs a weakness, like 2x potion fire destroys, or super / reflect shot destroys)
x--- "IT" - not sure want this


expansion:

difficulty system
genesis gIV - quest, ? battle, record
+music from this is good too

4th level+ monters & generators
- ghosts will get to shoot
- grunts will throw clubs infreq
- demons will have "fire"

randomly leave out wall -> exit if more than {X} wall segs
score mult applies to potion death pts, but perhaps 50% of mult
yellow teleports that can select further away
blue or purple teleports that are unit linked - not to nearest visible
pushable or shootable walls to temp block a teleport
respawning generators (none respawn > level 4)

new maps, perhaps with a maphack type system using the "image" set ops
"bonkers" level - see 207 img from bkg set - (in this case, do a "close to player" exit incase level is not playable)
lvl 1-7 as gauntlet
level 8-69 from gauntlet set
unpin, mirror & flip 70 - 99
100+ add in new maps, enhancements
- slow down treasure rooms occur freq, but every 4th have a chance for a "super" treasure room
- super treasure room idea - potion bomb "key" blocks & perm potion "key" blocks

monsters could act even weirder - like a bunch just run off until they "see" a player later
- some might be "bonkers", attacking other monsters, taking & holding keys or treasures
- "patrol" monsters that walk a beat until they "see" a player
basilisk

buy stuff guy, with new stuffs, keys, food, potions. temps



done:

x-- wiz potion fire does not kill gens
- killing gens is now distance (radius) derived - even warrior does some damage close up

x-- title screen scroll
-- can this be a .gif anim ?
x-- intro screen sequence
-- rotate thru image set
> with exception of demo play and posting saved scores
> and monster level > 3 boost stats display -- if we want to give those

x-- levels loop with random select

x-- doors auto open on stall timer
x-- walls -> exits on stall timer long
x-- cant shoot over exits !
(could also shoot over keys)

x- level 1 & 2 gens & monsters set in level
x- monster / generator levels ? - by score and monster health I am not sure this is implemented the same as gauntlet arcade
	- done visually, health & kill must be tested vs. player shots

x- multi point death potion kill = 1000, 2000,1000, 4000, 2000, 6000, 2000, 8000

x- score multiplier - _______- since multi-player isnt finished I'll gather this was left unfinished as well
	- a single player "times out" multiplier is done
	- multiplayer followup will expand that code

x- teleporters
	- the g1 fade controlling which nearest telep is not implemented

x- traps making walls vanish - up to 16 diff trap / wall linked elements as of now

x- shootable food / potions
